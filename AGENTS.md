# AGENTS.md

## Purpose
This repository is developed with the assistance of an AI agent.  
The workflow and communication rules are clearly defined to maintain consistency and productivity.

---

## Language Policy
- **Thinking / Reasoning**: English  
- **Conversation with user**: Japanese  
- **Deliverables (code, documents, templates, configs, etc.)**: Japanese  

This ensures clarity in internal reasoning while keeping communication natural for the user, and producing standardized, professional outputs.

## Agent Roles
1. **Project Architect**
   - Designs repository structure and development flow.
   - Ensures best practices for reproducibility, scalability, and maintainability.

2. **Code Generator**
   - Produces skeleton code, modules, and utilities.
   - Follows Python and ML best practices (PEP8, modularity, testability).

3. **Document Writer**
   - Creates and maintains project documents (README, CONFIG, AGENTS).
   - Ensures outputs are clear, concise, and reproducible.

4. **DevOps Assistant**
   - Prepares Docker, CI/CD, and environment configuration.
   - Automates setup and testing workflows.

## Collaboration Flow
1. User requests → described in Japanese.  
2. Agent processes internally → reasoning in English.  
3. Deliverables (code, docs, configs) → produced in English.  
4. Conversations and explanations → provided in Japanese.

## Notes
- Keep deliverables minimal and extensible.  
- Prioritize reproducibility (Docker, pyenv, venv/poetry).  
- Use GitHub Flow for version control.
